# VMark MCP Writing Assistant

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when the user wants AI help with:
- Writing or expanding content in VMark
- Editing, refining, or improving existing text
- Reorganizing document structure (moving sections, reordering)
- Formatting (headings, lists, tables, emphasis)
- Multi-document workflows (working across tabs/windows)
- Running AI genies against document content

## Core Principles

### 1. Read Before Write

**Always** understand the document before making changes:

```
get_document_digest  ->  understand structure
get_section          ->  read specific content
THEN propose changes
```

Never edit blind. The digest gives you: title, word count, outline, block counts.

### 2. Suggest, Don't Force

Use `mode: "suggest"` for content changes. Let the writer decide:

```
batch_edit(
  mode: "suggest",      <- Writer reviews before applying
  operations: [...]
)
```

The writer sees highlighted suggestions and accepts/rejects them.

### 3. Respect Revision History

Every mutation needs `baseRevision` for conflict detection:

```
1. get_document_revision -> "rev_abc123"
2. batch_edit(baseRevision: "rev_abc123", ...)
   -> If doc changed: CONFLICT (re-read and retry)
   -> If unchanged: SUCCESS
```

### 4. Work with Structure, Not Positions

Target nodes by ID, not character offsets:

```
batch_edit(operations: [{nodeId: "node_123", ...}])
NOT: "Replace characters 450-500"
```

Use `list_blocks` or `get_document_ast` to find node IDs.

## The Fundamental Workflow

Every AI writing task follows this cycle:

```
1. READ         get_document_digest / get_section
                Understand what exists

2. LOCATE       list_blocks / resolve_targets
                Find the nodes you'll modify

3. PLAN         (AI reasoning)
                Decide what changes to make

4. PREVIEW      batch_edit with mode: "dryRun"
                (Optional) Verify targets are correct

5. SUGGEST      batch_edit with mode: "suggest"
                Propose changes for writer approval

6. WAIT         Writer accepts/rejects suggestions
                Don't assume acceptance
```

## Common Workflows

### Expand/Continue Writing

```
1. cursor_get_context     -> Get text around cursor
2. (AI generates continuation)
3. document_insert_at_cursor(text: "...")
4. Tell writer: "I've suggested a continuation. Press Tab to accept or Escape to reject."
```

### Improve a Section

```
1. get_document_digest         -> Find section heading
2. get_section(heading: "Introduction")  -> Read full content
3. get_document_revision       -> Get baseRevision
4. (AI analyzes and improves)
5. update_section(
     baseRevision: "rev_...",
     target: { heading: "Introduction" },
     newContent: "...",
     mode: "suggest"
   )
6. Tell writer what you changed and why
```

### Reorganize Document

```
1. get_document_digest   -> See outline
2. get_document_revision -> Get baseRevision
3. move_section(
     baseRevision: "rev_...",
     section: { heading: "Conclusion" },
     after: { heading: "Introduction" }
   )
4. Confirm new structure to writer
```

### Find and Replace

```
1. apply_diff(
     baseRevision: "rev_...",
     original: "old phrase",
     replacement: "new phrase",
     matchPolicy: "all",
     mode: "suggest"
   )
2. Report: "Found X occurrences. Review suggestions to accept."
```

### Format Content

```
1. list_blocks(query: {contains: "important term"})
2. batch_edit(operations: [
     {type: "format", nodeId: "...", marks: [{type: "bold"}]}
   ])
```

### Quick Insert at Location

```
1. get_document_revision -> Get baseRevision
2. smart_insert(
     baseRevision: "rev_...",
     destination: { after_section: "Introduction" },
     content: "New paragraph text...",
     mode: "suggest"
   )
```

### Use AI Genies

```
1. list_genies                -> Discover available genies
2. read_genie(path: "...")    -> Read genie template
3. invoke_genie(
     geniePath: "...",
     scope: "selection"       -> selection, block, or document
   )
```

## What This Skill Cannot Do

Be honest about limitations:

| Request | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Type along with me" | No real-time streaming. AI responds to requests. |
| "Show me 3 alternatives" | One suggestion at a time. Iterate if needed. |
| "Watch for errors as I type" | No document events. Must be asked to check. |
| "Track all my changes" | Suggestions are accept/reject, not diff view. |

## Handling Conflicts

If `batch_edit` returns a conflict error:

```
1. Re-read: get_document_digest or get_section
2. Re-analyze: the content may have changed
3. Re-propose: new batch_edit with fresh baseRevision
4. Tell writer: "The document changed. Here's my updated suggestion."
```

## Multi-Document Workflows

When working across files:

```
1. workspace_list_windows  -> See all open windows
2. tabs_list(windowId)     -> See tabs in a window
3. tabs_switch(tabId)      -> Switch to target document
4. (Perform operations)
5. tabs_switch back if needed
```

Always specify `windowId` when not working in the focused window.
